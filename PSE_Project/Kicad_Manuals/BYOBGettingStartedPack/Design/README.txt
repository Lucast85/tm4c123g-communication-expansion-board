This is a compilation of design resources to get someone started on designing and eventually building their own BoosterPack plug-in module for Texas Instruments LaunchPads. This is a good place to get started, but not an exhaustive list. Designing your hardware is solely your responsibility and proper research into the availabe tools and resources is always a good idea. This list only acts as a suggestion guide.

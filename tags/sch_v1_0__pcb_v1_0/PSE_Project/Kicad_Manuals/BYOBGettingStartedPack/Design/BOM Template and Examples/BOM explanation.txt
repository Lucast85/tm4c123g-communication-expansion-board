The BOM is your list of components you need to build a BoosterPack. Examples of components are resistors, op amps, LEDs, sensors, and specialized ICs (integrated circuits or “chips”). You will need a BOM so that you can order components from your PCB manufacturer or from a components supplier like Digikey, Mouser, Element14, and many others. A sample BOM template is provided here.
